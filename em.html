            <div id="overview">
              <p class="paragraphBottom">As conversational agents are increasingly being integrated into digital products, the role of verbal and visual cues in CUIs cannot be understated. Such cues act as the bridge between system and user, creating a human facing persona that lends itself to communicating with and
              supporting users. We created <span class="inlineSuperscript colorChange" id="super">Em,</span><span class="superscript"
              id="superSmall">1</span> a CUI for Southwest Airlines, to reflect a brand that is marketed as 'people first' and aims to support passengers during every step of their journey.</p>

            <div class="deliverablesImg3"><img src="images/aiga/Browse-Quotes.gif"></img></div>
            <p class="deliverablesText3">Em provides users with a time estimate for when they should leave for the airport, taking into account real time data on
              traffic and security lines.</p>

            <h1 class="deliverablesHeading2">Boarding</h1>
            <div class="deliverablesImg4"><img src="images/aiga/Highlight%20Surf.gif"></img></div>
            <p class="deliverablesText4">Em utilizes geolocation data to inform users when they should get moving to be on time for boarding.</p>

            <h1 class="deliverablesHeading3">Mitigating flight anxiety</h1>
            <div class="deliverablesImg1"><img src="images/aiga/External-Links.gif"></img></div>
            <p class="deliverablesText1">Upon detecting a fast heartbeat, Em checks in on users who might be experiencing flight anxiety and provides a series of quiet
              interventions to calm them down in flight.</p>

            <h1 class="deliverablesHeading1">Landing contact check-ins</h1>
            <div class="deliverablesImg3"><img src="images/aiga/Spot-Words.gif"></img></div>
            <p class="deliverablesText3">Em texts the user's key contacts upon landing to let them know they have arrived at their destination safely.</p>

           <!-- Motion Exercises -->
            <h5 class="projectHeading">Motion Exercises</h5>
            <p class="projectText paragraphBottom">To get us in the right headspace, we each animated a single circle to try our hand at reflecting various emotions and states through motion. We later animated these same states
            with our chosen brand in mind, and came together to compare and map how each animation conveyed a different emotion.</p>

            <!-- Use Cases -->
            <h5 class="projectHeading" >Use Cases</h5>
            <p class="projectText paragraphBottom">We began to investigate the user journey of catching a flight, from booking to landing. We mapped these points
              in the user's journey to potential places where a CUI could intervene.</p>
            <p class="projectText">With these preliminary assumptions in mind, we conducted usability interviews with Southwest passengers to determine the need for our proposed
              interventions, and the kinds of travellers who might benefit from them.</p>

            <!-- Storyboarding -->
            <h5 class="projectHeading">The Journey</h5>
            <p class="projectText paragraphBottom">With our assumptions validated and a deeper understanding of real user needs during a flight, we began to storyboard concept ideas
            and create our our script to translate our four primary scenarios into a cohesive storyline.</p>
            <div class="carousel"
              data-flickity='{ "freeScroll": true, "wrapAround": true, "autoPlay": true}'>

            <!-- Brand -->
            <h5 class="projectHeading">Southwest's Brand</h5>
            <p class="projectText paragraphBottom">During our initial interviews, several of our interviewees mentioned that Southwest feels like a friendly and trustworthy brand. Similarly, Southwest
              markets itself as a 'people first' brand that services it's customers with heart. With these insights in mind, we dug into Southwest's visual assets and
              <a href="https://lippincott.com/work/southwest-airlines/" target="_blank"><span class="colorChange" span style="font-family: 'Vulf Sans', sans-serif;">rebrand by Lippincott ↗</span></a>
              , and began to think about how these abstract attributes could be conveyed visually.</p>
              <div class="imgFull">
                <img src="images/em/benchmarks.png">
                <figcaption>Style benchmarks that we used for concept video inspiration. We gravitated towards friendly and approachable visuals.</figcaption>
              </div>

            <!-- Creating the CUI -->
            <h5 class="projectHeading">Creating the CUI</h5>
            <p class="projectText paragraphBottom">While our initial CUI form explorations drew inspiration from shapes from aircrafts and Southwest's logo itself, we eventually settled on using Southwest's existing
            heart logo, a motif which many found to be inseperable from the brand. The heart morphs to fit the underlying tone of each state.</p>
            <p class="projectText">We eventually settled on final states: waking up, listening, speaking and meditation.</p>


            <!-- Visual Assets -->
            <h5 class="projectHeading">Visual Assets</h5>
            <p class="projectText paragraphBottom">To prepare for animation, we created a library of visual assets. We drew upon Southwest's primary brand colors and created
            visual assets inspired by Bauhaus design. Drawing upon the principles of the movement, simple shapes and lines were used as a foundation to create more complex assets
            in order to emphasize how a fundamentally strong service foundation is key to the service-customer relationship.</p>
